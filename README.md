# Rock Paper Scissors: Avengers Civil War Showdown
Welcome to the Avengers edition of Rock Paper Scissors! 

In this game the same rules from the classic game apply, as do the goals from Avengers: Civil War- come out on top against your once-ally oponents!

Your choice of heroes is between Captain America (rock), Spider-Man (paper) and Iron Man (scissors)
Use the terms "cap", "spidey" and "stark" to play. As Tony Stark rides in the backseat and Spider-Man takes the bus, there's no need to skip out on shortcuts here.

The heroes of this game follow the same logic as the classic weapons, in addition to their own details:

-Cap uses his shield to deflect Stark's energy blast

-Spidey catches Cap by surprise, swipes his shield and webs his hands

-Stark takes away Spideys suit and leaves him to walk home in Hello Kitty pajamas.

Armed with this knowledge, choose your Avenger wisely as you compete for victory against your AI oponent!
